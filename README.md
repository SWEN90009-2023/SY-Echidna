# SY-Echidna
Welcome! We are Team Echidna.

This repository contains all resources involved in our requirements analysis of the Synaesthesia project in SWEN90009 Software Requirements Analysis 2023.
 
## :speech_balloon: Project Description
Synaesthesia is a perceptual condition where an individual's senses or cognitions can trigger a secondary sense or cognition. For example grapheme-colour synaesthesia describes an individual's ability to associate symbols with particular colours. This condition is rare, but is more commonly seen in people in creative fields, such as artists and musicians. The purpose of this project is to create a tool that can diagnose whether an individual is a synaesthete, with a focus on music-to-visual synaesthesia.
